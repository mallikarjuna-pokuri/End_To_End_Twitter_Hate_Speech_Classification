# End_To_End_Twitter_Hate_Speech_Classification

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Twitter Hate Speech Classification project! This project aims to build a robust and efficient system for identifying hate speech on Twitter. Hate speech detection is crucial for maintaining a safe and inclusive online environment.

## Introduction
Hate speech on social media platforms, especially Twitter, is a growing concern. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to automatically classify tweets into categories like hate speech, offensive language, or non-offensive. The end-to-end process includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **Data Ingestion**: In this module, data is collected and ingested into the system for further processing.

- **Data Transformation**: The ingested data undergoes preprocessing and transformation to prepare it for model training. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for the machine learning pipeline.

- **Model Training**: TensorFlow is utilized to train a hate speech classification model. The model is trained on the preprocessed data, techniques in natural language processing.

- **Model Evaluation**: Once trained, the model is evaluated using a separate dataset to assess its performance and accuracy in classifying hate speech on Twitter.

- **FastAPI Backend**: The backend is built with FastAPI, providing a robust and efficient server for handling requests and interacting with the machine learning model.

- **Web Application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**: The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the hate speech classification system. Users can input tweets, and the system will classify them using the trained model.

- **Docker Integration**: The entire system is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.
